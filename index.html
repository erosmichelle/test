      Michelle and her husband Gil opened  up the first Thrive Hotel in the small resort town of of Oceanside, located on the Southern California coast. At the time, Michelle worked as a Product Designer in the technology field and ran the hotel part-time, together with her husband while they were raising 3 children under the age of 7. As business started to pick up, Michelle eventually quit her job and the family moved to Oceanside to run their resort full time. Much of the uniqueness of the hotel was a direct influence of Michelle's creative flair from her former career as a user-experience expert. Many in the hospitality industry attribute the hotel's success to the high-level of impeccability in the customer experience.
